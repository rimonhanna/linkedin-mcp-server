    """Ensure only one tool call at a time drives the shared LinkedIn browser.

    Two layers, because one is not enough:

    * an ``asyncio.Lock`` serializes calls inside this process, where several MCP
      sessions can share one server;
    * the profile lease serializes calls across processes, where each MCP client
      instance spawns its own server against the same Chromium profile. A
      process on the holder's version waits for the handoff; one on another
      version is refused at once, with the holder named.

    Without the second layer two processes open that profile simultaneously and
    the last one to close silently overwrites the other's cookies.

    Serial is not the same as paced, though, and this is also where the gap
    between consecutive calls lives. The account budget is not spent here: it
    is charged per page load at the navigation, since one call can be
    fourteen of them (``pacing.charge_navigation``).

    # would charge the account budget for activity that never happened and make
    # a status poll wait out a gap meant for page loads. Named rather than
    # derived: there is no flag on a tool saying whether it navigates, and a
    # wrong guess here is silent -- an unlisted local tool merely pays a gap it
    # did not owe, while a listed navigating one would escape pacing entirely.
